        Run the task. In this function, you can request lab resources from lab manager and log data to database
        with logger.

        ``request_resources`` will not return until all the requested resources are available. So the task will
        pend until it gets the requested resources, which prevent the conflict in the resource allocation.

        When a device get the requested device and sample positions, it also takes over the ownership of these
        resources, i.e., other task cannot use the device or request the sample positions this task has requested.

        We use a context manager to manage the ownership of the resources. when a task is completed, all the devices
        and sample positions will be released automatically.
